## Technologies Used

## Project Structure
```

|   |-- form.css   # Stylesheet for the form

## How It Works
- Clicking on the **Sign Up** button moves the form to the left and displays the registration fields.
- Clicking on the **Sign In** button moves the form back to the right and displays the login fields.
- The transition effect is achieved using CSS animations and JavaScript event listeners.
